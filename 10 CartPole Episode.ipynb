    "In a Markov Decision Process we have an agent immersed in an environment.  At any given time, the agent finds itself in a state and it must select one of the available actions.  Upon taking an action, the environment reponds by assigning a reward and transitioning the agent to a successor state.  This loop continues until a terminal state is reached.  It is interesting to ask: could we learn to act optimally in such a setup? could we learn to select sequences of actions that maximize long term cumulative rewards? "

In other words, the pole behaves as a solid inverted pendulum and is unstable about the desired configuration.  A simple implementation could use a revolute/hinge joint between the cart and the pole, and a translational joint between the cart and the ground. "

The wrapper sets up the CartPole physics, accepts the available actions (i.e. forces), and calculates the state transitions (kinematic response) after every time step (an MAPDL load step).  For reference, OpenAI Gym provides its own ad hoc [environment](https://gym.openai.com/envs/CartPole-v1/) for solving the system's [kinematic equations](https://github.com/openai/gym/blob/master/gym/envs/classic_control/cartpole.py)"
