Reinforcement Machine Learning using PyMAPDL: Cart-Pole Simulation
=================================================================

This notebook demonstrates a reinforcement machine learning example using MAPDL
through PyMAPDL.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure you have PyMAPDL and MAPDL installed. Visit `PyMAPDL - Getting
Started <https://mapdldocs.pyansys.com/getting_started/index.html>`_

Next, clone the `ml-rl-cartpole <https://github.com/pyansys/ml-rl-cartpole>`_
repository and make sure you are in the correct directory with:

.. code::

   git clone https://github.com/pyansys/ml-rl-cartpole
   cd ml-rl-cartpole

Usage
-----
Start `JupyterLab <https://jupyter.org/>`_ and open `cartpole.ipynb
<https://github.com/pyansys/ml-rl-cartpole/blob/main/cartpole.ipynb>`_. Follow
the directions in the example.
